This repository is part of Make app-to-phone call using Flutter blogposts.

## Setup flutter SDK

Download, extract and confgure [flutter SDK](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).

Fortunately, flutter comes with a tool that allows us to verify if SDK and all required "components" are present and configured correctly. Run this command:

Check if everything is configured correctly:

```cmd
flutter doctor
```

## Run the app

There are multiple ways to run the app. Easiest way is to open the whole project in the [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) with [Flutter plugin](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/tools/android-studio) installed. Open Flutter project (root of this repo) and run app targetting one of the platforms.

Optionally you can open iOS project (`ios/Runner.xcworkspace` folder) in Xcode and run iOS app or Andrid project in Android Studio (`android` folder) and run Android App. This is possible because Flutter project consists of iOS and Android projects.
